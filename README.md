# Automated Research Report Generator

This Streamlit application leverages various AI models and advanced utilities to generate comprehensive research reports, perform quality analysis, and enhance research capabilities.

## Features

The application includes the following key features:

### 1. Multiple AI Models
- **Provider Selection:** Choose between Google Gemini, OpenAI (GPT), and Anthropic (Claude) as your AI model provider.
- **Model Selection:** Select specific models within each provider (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`).
- **Flexible API Key Management:** API keys are loaded from `.streamlit/secrets.toml` for security, with a fallback to direct input in the UI if not found.

### 2. Quality & Intelligence
- **Smart Summarization:** Generate a concise executive summary of the entire research report.
- **Table Summary Generation:** Automatically generate summaries for tables found in research content.
- **Contextual Research Generation:** Each generated section builds upon the content of previous sections, ensuring a coherent and logical flow throughout the report.
- **Readability Analysis:** Analyze the readability of the generated content using various metrics.

### 3. Enhanced Research Capabilities
- **Web Scraping Integration:** Perform web research to find academic sources and scrape their content (HTML and PDF) using `googlesearch-python`.
- **Citation Management:** Auto-generate bibliographies in popular academic styles (APA, MLA, Chicago) based on the found sources.
- **Custom Templates:** Utilize pre-built templates for different research types (Scientific, Business, Literary) to structure your reports, pre-fill system prompts, and suggest keywords/questions.
- **Deep Research Option:** Conduct in-depth research by allowing the AI to ask clarifying questions and refine its understanding of the topic.
- **Interactive Research Chatbot:** Engage with a chatbot that has memory of previous conversations and can answer questions based on the generated research report. Includes a "Clear Chat" button for easy conversation reset.

## Recent Updates and Bug Fixes

- **Resolved Generation Errors:** Fixed "Validation error in generate_section: Invalid section_data type", "name 'genai' is not defined", and "module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'APIError'" errors.
- **Improved Spinner Messages:** The spinner text for content generation has been refined to be more concise, removing model version numbers and attempt counts (e.g., "Crafting the Introduction with Gemini Flash").
- **Contextual Section Generation:** Implemented logic to ensure that each research section is generated with awareness of the content from preceding sections.
- **Chatbot Memory and Control:** The research chatbot now maintains conversation history, allowing for more natural interactions. A "Clear Chat" button has been added for user convenience.
- **Removed "Table of Contents" from default sections:** The default template no longer automatically generates a "Table of Contents" section.
- **Removed Keyword Analysis:** The "Analyze Keywords" feature has been removed to streamline the application and avoid reliance on external dependencies for this specific functionality.

## Setup and Installation

To get this application up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexBiobelemo/Ereuna/
cd Project-Geo
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
The application relies on several Python libraries. Install them using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` file contains:
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
google-generativeai>=0.3.0
python-docx>=0.8.11
fpdf2>=2.7.6
python-pptx>=0.6.21
Pillow>=10.0.0
openai>=1.0.0
anthropic>=0.3.0
pypdf>=3.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.2
textstat>=0.7.0
googlesearch-python>=1.2.0
```

### 4. Configure API Keys
The application requires API keys for the AI models you wish to use. For security, it's recommended to store these in a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the root directory of your project.

Create a file named `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your API keys:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```
Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`, and `"YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"` with your actual API keys. If a key is not provided in `secrets.toml`, the application will prompt you to enter it in the Streamlit UI.

## How to Run

Once the dependencies are installed and API keys are configured, you can run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run research.py
```

This command will open the application in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  **Configuration:**
    *   Select your preferred AI Model Provider (Gemini, GPT, Claude) and a specific model.
    *   Ensure your API keys are correctly configured (either in `secrets.toml` or entered directly).
    *   Optionally, select a **Research Template** to pre-configure the system prompt, suggested sections, keywords, and research questions for different report types (e.g., Scientific, Business, Literary).

2.  **Research Configuration:**
    *   Enter the main **Research Topic**.
    *   Provide **Keywords** (comma-separated) to guide the AI.
    *   List **Research Questions** (comma-separated) that the report should address.
    *   Enable **Deep Research** for more detailed and extensive output.

3.  **Generate Report:**
    *   Click the "ðŸš€ Generate Research Report" button. The AI will generate content for each section based on your inputs and the selected template, with each subsequent section building on the previous one.

4.  **Quality & Intelligence:**
    *   After generation, use the "Generate Executive Summary" button in this section.
    *   The executive summary will be displayed in an expandable section.
    *   Utilize "Analyze Readability" for insights into your report's quality.

5.  **Interactive Research Chatbot:**
    *   After generating a report, use the "Research Chatbot" section to ask questions about the report content. The chatbot will remember previous turns in the conversation.
    *   Click "Clear Chat" to reset the conversation history.

6.  **Export Options:**
    *   Generate and download the report as a DOCX document or a plain text file.
